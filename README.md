# Living-Particles
An attempt at an artificial life screensaver.

How this should be Read:
1) Neuron.py
2) Brain.py
3) Body.py
4) Larticle.py
5) Handler.py
6) Create_random_larticles.py
7) Pygame.py

How this should be Run:
1) Have python 3, (I made this in 3.5).
2) Install pygame and pickle on python with python pip install pygame and python pip install pickle.
3) All files need to be in the same folder.
4) Run Pygame.py.
5) You can set the initial gridsize in the Pygame.py file

Please tell me if something goes wrong.

It took madness and time to make this, it will take some madness and time to comment the code.
The Neuron.py file is a gift, it is a script for a feed forward neuron with sigmoid scaling and backwards propagation, tho the backwards propagation is not used in the rest of the program because it kills the framerate, a simple example of it is in the test function.
I made this because the autistic kid in me likes to look at it. Have fun.
